# Digital-Dustbin

Ino file is for Arduino interface with Android app and Ultrasonic Sensor.
Aia file is to edit and change the android apk as per your requirement.

 The features and specifications involved in this development include a digital dustbin which detects human with the help of ultrasonic sensor and guides him by giving instruction using speakers and LCD display. After the user shows his QR code of Aadhar card on the scanner, the window of the dustbin opens for collecting waste until the person is standing there. The system will read the data from QR code, analyze the amount of waste using sensors and based on that the user will be credited some limited discount points once a day. Dustbins placed near gardens can offer free Wi-Fi to the users for the decided time so that they can enjoy Wi-Fi while sitting in the garden. When the dustbin is full, another ultrasonic sensor detects the threshold level and notifies higher authorities. Arduino Uno was chosen as the central controller unit of the system, interfaced with Bluetooth Module, Ultrasonic Sensor and Servo motor. A load cell was used to calculate the weight of the waste thrown by the user, by converting the force and pressure of the waste into electrical signals, which in return was displayed as an output through LCD display.
